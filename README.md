# Welcome to the Simple Game Engine

## An easy to use simple game engine created by Zeb.

## Getting Started

### Setup

In your text editor create an ```index.html``` file and open it in VSCode (or any other text editor). In VSCode you can type "!" then press tab to autofill the HTML boilerplate. If you are not using VSCode you will have to write out the boilerplate HTML.

Inclue these two script tags inbetween the body tags of you HTML.
```
<script type="module" src="https://www.unpkg.com/browse/simple-game-engine@latest/dist/index.umd.min.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
```

Create the ```main.js``` file in the same directory as your index.html file.

You're all set!
