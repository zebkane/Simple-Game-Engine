## An easy to use simple game engine created by Zeb.

## Getting Started

### Setup

In your text editor create an index.html file. In VSCode you can type "!" then press tab to autofill the HTML boilerplate.
Inclue these two script tags inbetween the body tags of you HTML.

`<script type="module" src="https://www.unpkg.com/browse/simple-game-engine@latest/dist/index.umd.min.js"></script>

<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>`

Create the main.js file in the same directory as your index.html file.

You're all set!
